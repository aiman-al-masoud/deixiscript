Some and Every as values of cardinality in Numerality? Do NOT just assume that tuple means 'AND'?

Default connective when using implicit is 'OR'? Because that will match more stuff more easily. Eg: "man ride horse" -> concept of man rides concept of horse, or individual man rides etc...

All "argument passing" (derivation clauses) through deictic dictionary, not match and subst.

Normalized:
- no implicit references, only explicit
- everything is decompressed
- verb sentences don't cotain negations or commands

maybe "conceptual" and "individual" modes that can be triggered with some conventional command for testing.

Random AST generator for fuzz testing?

- test semantic/idiomatic match()

## Problems

- less than greater than as vague commands (tell)
