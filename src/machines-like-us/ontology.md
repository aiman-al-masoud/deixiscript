# RULES

1. No single correct way.
1. Iterative process.
1. Concepts close to objects and relationships in domain.

# 1 Determine Domain and Scope

Relevant concepts and relations are a function of competency questions, the kind of problems that the ontology should be able to solve.

# ~~2 Consider Reusing~~

# 3 Enumerate Important Terms

An exhaustive list of terms that should be included in the ontology.

# 4 Define Classes and Hierarchy

## Top Down

Specific concepts first, then generalize.

## Bottom Up

General concepts first, then specify.

## Hybrid

Salient concepts first, then generalize and/or specify.


# 5 Define Slots, aka: properties of Classes

They are the attributes of a class.


# 6 Define the Facets of the Slots

Characteristics of a class' property.

1. Slot Cardinality: how many values a slot can hold.
1. Slot value type: primitive types, or other objects.
1. Domain: name of the property.
1. Range: ???


# 7 Create Objects

1. Choose a class
1. Create an individual instance
1. Fill the slots
