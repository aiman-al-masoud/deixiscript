# How to fill up "which-gaps" when parsing?
- use of transitive vs intransitive verb distinction in ST post-processing?
- use of (ugly) explicit gap
- use of special pronoun (unnatural in English)

# Use brython to package the interpreter for the web
https://brython.info/static_tutorial/en/index.html

# Fuzz testing
Random AST generator for fuzz testing?

# Ordinality
Currently only supports first/last, and limit DD

# I/O Example with stdin and stdout buffers
- the standard output is "ciao mondo"
- do print the string when the standard output is the string
- do print "ciao mondo"

# Simplify
Since define is called recursively once and for all, you may be able to avoid calling eval() from some of the other functions or maybe even call define at the top-level outside of eval

# Implement Examples
- Tic-Tac-Toe: a free spot is a spot that does not have an "x" nor an "o". after a spot has an "x" then a free spot has an "o".
- odd/even number recognition

# Maybe Fancy Math Ops
1 and 2 and 3 + 0 // 6

# Maybe limit decompress
only one list (subject exor object, "as" can't be > 1)

# Errors and meta for error messages


---------------------
Note to self: a question may create a whole new entity (thus having side effects even on the WM). Actually no, right now a generic simple sentence is converted to an event first (a "nounphrase") so none of its constituents are created if it is not (the whole thing) a command.

Method match is purely structural, no access to KB, doesn't call execute.
