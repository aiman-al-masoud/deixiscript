x's y increments means: x's y = x's y + 10.0.
x's y decrements means: x's y = x's y - 10.0.

x is near y means: 
    x's x-coord = y's x-coord,
    x's x-coord = y's y-coord.

x hits y means:
    y's health decrements.
 
there is a player.
there is an enemy.
the player's x-coord = 10.0.
the player's y-coord = 10.0.
the enemy's x-coord = 10.0.
the enemy's y-coord = 10.0.
the player's health = 10.0.
the enemy's health = 10.0.
