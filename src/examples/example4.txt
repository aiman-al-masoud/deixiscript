x's y increments means: x's y = x's y + 10.0.
x's y decrements means: x's y = x's y - 10.0.

an enemy can hit a player, if the enemy is near the player.
a defender can hit an enemy, if the defender is near the enemy.

an enemy is near a player means: 
    the enemy's x-coord = the player's x-coord, 
    the enemy's y-coord = the player's y-coord.

a defender is near an enemy means: 
    the defender's x-coord = the enemy's x-coord, 
    the defender's y-coord = the enemy's y-coord.

an enemy hits the player means: 
    the player's health decrements.

a defender hits an enemy means: 
    the enemy's health decrements.

a player is dead, means the health = 0.0.
an enemy is dead, means the health = 0.0.
a player is alive, means the health > 0.0.
an enemy is alive, means the health > 0.0.


an enemy moves right means the x-coord increments.
an enemy moves left means the x-coord decrements.
an enemy moves down means the y-coord increments.
an enemy moves up means the y-coord decrements.

an enemy can move right if the enemy is alive (0.2 seconds).
an enemy can move left if the enemy is alive (0.2 seconds).
an enemy can move up if the enemy is alive (0.2 seconds).
an enemy can move down if the enemy is alive (0.2 seconds).

a defender moves right means the x-coord increments.
a defender moves left means the x-coord decrements.
a defender moves down means the y-coord increments.
a defender moves up means the y-coord decrements.
a defender can move right.
a defender can move left.
a defender can move up.
a defender can move down.
