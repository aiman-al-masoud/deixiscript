x's y increments means: x's y = x's y + 10.0.
x's y decrements means: x's y = x's y - 10.0.

an enemy can hit a player, if the enemy is near the player.

an enemy is near a player means: 
    the enemy's x-coord = the player's x-coord, 
    the enemy's y-coord = the player's y-coord.

an enemy hits the player means: 
    the player's health decrements.

a player is dead, means: the health = 0.0.

an enemy moves right means the x-coord increments.
an enemy moves left means the x-coord decrements.
an enemy moves down means the y-coord increments.
an enemy moves up means the y-coord decrements.
an enemy can move right.
an enemy can move left.
an enemy can move up.
an enemy can move down.

there is an enemy.
there is a player.
the player's health = 400.0.
the player's x-coord = 300.0.
the enemy's x-coord = 100.0.
the player's y-coord = 300.0.
the enemy's y-coord = 100.0.

the enemy should ensure the player is dead.

the enemy's color =red.
