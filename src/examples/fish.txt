a fish is amphibious means the kind = amphibious.
a fish is dead means the location != water.
an amphibious fish is dead means the health <= 0.0.

there is a fish.
there is an amphibious fish.
the amphibious fish's health = 10.0.
the amphibious fish's location = land.
the non-amphibious fish's location = land.

the non-amphibious fish is dead, (the amphibious fish is dead) = false?
