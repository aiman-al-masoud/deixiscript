# Syntactic

They all mostly have to do with unclear associativity.

## Analytical Ambiguity
“software fault tolerance”, can be tolerance to software faults or fault tolerance achieved by
software.

(software fault) tolerance
software (fault tolerance)


## Attachment Ambiguity
“I go to visit a friend with a red car” means either that I go with the red car or that the friend I’m visiting has a red car.

(I go to visit (a friend with a red car))
(I go to visit (a friend) (with a red car))


## Coordinator Ambiguity
“She likes red cars and bikes”, where it is not clear whether she likes all bikes or
only red ones (two coordinators in a sentence)

She likes (red (cars and bikes))
She likes (red cars) and (bikes)


# Anaphoric Ambiguity

Which antecedent does a noun phrase point to?

(+ Cataphoric and Deictic in general)

# Vagueness

Leads to loose interpretations, especially when quantities are involved. "many/few"... Temporal ambiguity is a special case.

# Comparatives and Superlatives

Comparatives without a comparison term. Superlatives with an unclear context.

# Disjunctions

Special case of coordinator ambiguity. In the case of a sentence with side-effects, which branch of the OR should run?

# Escape Clauses

“The system, if possible, updates the data every 2 h”. Makes a requirement weak, vague or unverifiable. 

# Usage of a Weak Verb

"May" or "may not" ...

# Quantifiers

“All pilots have a red car”

* "All" pilots in what context?
* The same, shared, red car; or a different one each?
* Does it describe the general concept of a "pilot", or every individual pilot? (Machines Like Us)

# Underspecification

generic term that lacks a specifier.

“It shall be possible for the driver to store numbers in the radio”

What numbers? Related to anaphora, because it could be resolved by context.

# Passive Voice

The doer of the action may be omitted.
