# Naturalistic Programming

_A paradigm in the making._

It is fair to say that the entire discipline of programming will undergo massive revolutions during the latter part of this century.

Some reputable experts seem to take the position that traditional programming languages will die at the hands of AI models of tomorrow, and that coding will be replaced by a discipline not unlike psychology, quite reminiscent of the obscure Asimovian discipline of Robopsychology.

# Naturalistic Ideas

## Anaphora.
* No tmp variables, but (dynamic) anaphoric bindings.
## Dynamic Groups.
## Naturalistic "Style"
* Normal case mentioned BEFORE exceptional cases.
## Structures, Actions and Times.
## Generalized (statement level) anaphora to refer to operations (full sentences!).
## Temporal referencing.
```
x is red.
before that, throw an error if it doesn't exist.
```
## Refining a statement or expression or function at a later point in the program text.
## Syntactic and Semantic Compression
* "x and y are red buttons" (syntactic)
* "x knows y and viceversa" (semantic)
## Polymorphism
