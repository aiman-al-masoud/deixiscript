# Naturalistic Programming

_A paradigm in the making._

It is fair to say that the entire discipline of programming is poised to undergo massive revolutions during the course of the century.

Some experts seem to take the position that traditional programming languages will die at the hands of the AI models of tomorrow [[1]](../bib/bib.md#the-end-of-programming), and that coding will be replaced by a discipline vaguely reminiscent of the obscure Asimovian practice of Robopsychology [[2]](../bib/bib.md#robopsychology).

Presently, AI models that can generate code from a natural language prompt are already available on the market; however, these are not the kind of future technologies envisioned by the author of "The End of Programming".

While capable of impressive feats of creative code generation, tools such as Github Copilot and ChatGPT are functionally equivalent to a very sophisticated way of "copying from stackoverflow", as they do not eliminate the overarching need for conscious human effort in revising and integrating the generated snippets of code into a carefully crafted assemblage.

The question remains open: could the AI models of the future grow so strong as to definitively kill programming languages?

A programming language is a system of notation to write a computer program, which in turn can be seen as a formal description of the problem to be solved.

Since their humble beginnings as machine code, programming languages have evolved to accomodate the human way of thinking, thus gradually emancipating themselves from the influence of the underlying hardware.

Could there be space for a new major paradigm in programming?

# Naturalistic Ideas

## Anaphora.
* No tmp variables, but (dynamic) anaphoric bindings.
## Dynamic Groups.
## Naturalistic "Style"
* Normal case mentioned BEFORE exceptional cases.
## Structures, Actions and Times.
## Generalized (statement level) anaphora to refer to operations (full sentences!).
## Temporal referencing.
```
x is red.
before that, throw an error if it doesn't exist.
```
## Refining a statement or expression or function at a later point in the program text.
## Syntactic and Semantic Compression
* "x and y are red buttons" (syntactic)
* "x knows y and viceversa" (semantic)
## Polymorphism
