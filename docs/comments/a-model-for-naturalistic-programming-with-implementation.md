> The authors stated that three types of references are observed in anaphoric relations: structural references; temporal references; and reflexive references. Anaphora is a natural language property that enables an entity (real or abstract) to be related to a pronoun or noun phrase without losing context. Traditional programming languages provide support only for explicit structural references such as “out.println(str)”, but not for indirect references such as “execute all methods”, and do not support reflexive references such as “execute the previous three instructions” and temporal references such as “execute the method before printing the string”. On the other hand, the authors stated that, while AspectJ uses a rudimentary form of temporal reference, it lacks the capacity to describe information taken from the context, in which a reflexive and temporal reference such as the last operation, which makes reference to any previous operation regardless of its context, could help to define expressiveness mechanisms closer to natural language
