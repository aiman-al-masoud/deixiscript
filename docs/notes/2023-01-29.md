# Generalize "ownership chain" methods for any predicate.

# Query for relations (method invocations), not just properties.

# Get rid of RootAction, an Action should correspond to a Clause one-to-one (DONE, except for MultiAction which creates more Actions).

# Every Action gets a Clause in its constructor. Clause has nullable predicate and args fields (DONE).

# Actions should be identifiable and queriable for "statement-level anaphora".

# Clause.query(Clause): Map[] to partly solve 1 and 2

## ownedBy(id: Id): Id[]

clause.query(clauseOf('of', 'X', id))


# A Wrapper could produce a Clause fully describing itself (DONE, imperfect)

... for the benefit of querying.

* A Wrapper will need to store its own global id (DONE).
* A Wrapper will need store Lexeme as value alongside string[] path in simpleConcepts dict (DONE).
* A Wrapper will need to store in a list non-concept predicates such as names (DONE).

## Stupid Strategy for querying in BaseEnviro (DONE):

Produce a Clause for each Wrapper, aggregate all, query aggregated super-clause.

Enviro also passes down query to each entity's clause() method, because it would be inefficient for wrapper to FULLY describe itself beyond the strict necessary.
