# Strengthen Macros

* Quantitative Adjectives lexemes ("zero-or-more", "one-or-more", "optional" ...), map each of them to a Cardinality.

* "or" syntax in macros, to be able to define an article as "defart or indefart" ...

# Multi-word lexemes for prettier macros 

* ("zero or more", "one or more", "noun phrase" ...)

# How to deal with lexeme type hierarchies ?

* "or" syntax in macros

* multi typed lexemes (each lexeme has a LIST of types)


# IMPORTANT : check if need to ENFORCE parsing more complex trees (longer Member list) BEFORE parsing less complex ones to avoid problems!
