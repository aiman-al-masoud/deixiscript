# Strengthen Macros

* Quantitative Adjectives lexemes ("zero-or-more", "one-or-more", "optional" ...), map each of them to a Cardinality.

* "or" syntax in macros, to be able to define an article as "defart or indefart" ...

# Multi-word lexemes for prettier macros 

* ("zero or more", "one or more", "noun phrase" ...)

# How to deal with lexeme type hierarchies ?

* "or" syntax in macros

* multi typed lexemes (each lexeme has a LIST of types)


# IMPORTANT : ENFORCE parsing precendence

"Precendence" isn't JUST number of members, but rather being at a "higher level" in the dependency graph.

If one ast A depends on another B, then A has parse precedence over B (eg: try parsing a copula sentence before just falling back to a noun phrase).

If two asts depend on each other, as in a cyclic dependecy, (for example like noun phrase and subordinate clause) then use number of members as fallback. (noun phrase has precendence over subordinate clause).

Sort asts (syntaxes) for precendence in Parser.
