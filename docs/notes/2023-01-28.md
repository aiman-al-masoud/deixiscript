# Naturalistic Ideas

## Anaphora.

* No tmp variables, but (dynamic) anaphoric bindings.

## Dynamic Groups.

## Naturalistic "Style"
* Normal case mentioned BEFORE exceptional cases.

## Structures, Actions and Times.

## Generalized (statement level) anaphora to refer to operations (full sentences!).

## Temporal referencing.
```
x is red.
before that, throw an error if it doesn't exist.
```
## Refining a statement or expression or function at a later point in the program text.

## Syntactic and Semantic Compression

"x and y are red buttons" (syntactic)

"x knows y and viceversa" (semantic)

## Polymorphism
