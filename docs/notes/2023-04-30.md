# 1 New Cst+Ast framework.
# 2 Eliminate Clause search algo, replace with simpler noun-phrase based choice.

-----

* rm macros/prelude 
* rm Lexeme
* rm Lexeme from Thing
* new evalAst()
* rm Clause
* new non-Clause based search algo for anaphora, use noun-phrase
* rm KoolParser and EagerLexer
* errors and warnings based on number/existence of anaphora
* typo resiliece
* How to choose the syntax for which to output an error message: the one with the greatest percentage of parsed components! Problems: seems like it's mostly never gonna fail, but cut short.
* add complements to simple-sentence


# Make helper verbs compulsory? Yes
* solves verb redefinition problem
* solves the verb-or-noun problem
* the root of a verb or a noun is an identifier
* verbal/nominal inflections handled by parser

# Keywords misrecognized as identifiers. Solved.
In parser, extract keywords ("literals") and prevent any keyword from being parsed as an identifier.

Problem: single chars (letters) are also literals, so the system rejects single letter identifiers! Even single numbers!

* support synthetic languages through roleS (one morpheme, many roles)
* optional simplification of math-expression into noun-phrase, expression polymorphism, see how
* optional logger for parser debug info
