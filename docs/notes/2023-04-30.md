# 1 New Cst+Ast framework.
# 2 Eliminate Clause search algo, replace with simpler noun-phrase based choice.

-----

tmp remove macros/prelude and focus on getting the json specification of Csts to work well and integrate it with Ast specificiation if possible

pluralizer grammar role
uniquant and final-s are both pluralizers
literal strings in Member for inline lexeme definition
are ---> type copula, no need to specify that root is be
assume that all other verbs are regular verbs ?????
rm cardinality from lexeme, make is a prop of a constituent
indefart is ---> new-operator
defart is ---> existing/default
the identifier and whitespace problem



function validateCst(ast,cst):boolean{
	// checks if the cst matches the ast, both given in as objects
}


maybe Cst should store the name of the Ast it is instantiating


extract keys as type from AstNode types, make lists of keys, use list to check if any given Cst conforms to the Ast type it claims to be instantiating. Doesn't work with expand!
