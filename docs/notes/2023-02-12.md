# Nested Wrapper objects

Tried:

```javascript
brain.context.enviro.set('id1', window).set({root:'window', type:'noun'})
```

How great would it be if "console of window" actually returned an object and you could say: "console of window logs ...", instead of having to insert into enviro a separate "top level" console object!


# About Actions as Wrappers (objects)

Tried:

```javascript
// inside of BaseActuator
context.enviro.set(getIncrementalId(), a).set({root : 'action', type : 'noun'})
```

Slows down execution (for some reason). More importantly: need a way to favor regular objects in lastReferenced/pronoun/it business, or else the last action becomes the last referenced object and breaks stuff.

```
the button is red.
it is black. // it===the button, not the "the button is red" action!
```
