# Nested Wrapper objects

Tried:

```javascript
brain.context.enviro.set('id1', window).set({root:'window', type:'noun'})
```

How great would it be if "console of window" actually returned an object and you could say: "console of window logs ...", instead of having to insert into enviro a separate "top level" console object!

Does object have owner? If it doesn't that's great, get it from the global scope.
If it does have an owner, get it from the owner (if the owner has an owner get it from its owner...). getWrapper(Context, clause, id)


every BaseWrapper object knows its parent object, so that if background=red, background "sets itself back" on the parent style.


Wrapper.get()


# About Actions as Wrappers (objects)

Tried:

```javascript
// inside of BaseActuator
context.enviro.set(getIncrementalId(), a).set({root : 'action', type : 'noun'})
```

Slows down execution (for some reason). More importantly: need a way to favor regular objects in lastReferenced/pronoun/it business, or else the last action becomes the last referenced object and breaks stuff.

```
the button is red.
it is black. // it===the button, not the "the button is red" action!
```
