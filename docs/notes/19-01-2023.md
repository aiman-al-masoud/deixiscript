Maybe a Clause should take a Token (verb, noun, adjective ...) as its predicate, instead of a simple string.

# Benefits:

* 	one single central reference for all words
* 	being able to recognize a pronoun in Enviro (for anaphora)
* 	information about number and gender (for anaphora)
* 	generating auditory response (adjectives and nouns in correct order)

	
# Changes:

*   BasicClause.predicate : Token
*   Clause.describe(): Token[]

Maybe an interface above Token that only includes the Tokens that can actually be predicates?


A predicate as well as a concept could *be tied to a Lexeme*:

```
{
	"root" : "red",
	"concept" : "color"
}
```


```
{
	"root" : "of",
	"concept" : "ownership"
}
```
