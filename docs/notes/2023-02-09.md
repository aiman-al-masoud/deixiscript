Inside of BaseWrapper.clause() you need to produce a piece of clause representing the hierarchical relationships eg: style(1), of(1, thisobj), background(2), of(2, 1)

Complete search doesn't scale, it would produce a humongous tree with thousands of branches, most of which irrelevant.

Unelegant Solution:

clause() becomes a regular method and accepts as input some information about the query-clause, so that each object can prepare an adequate representation of itself.

This is unelegant but should scale better.


Should ownership really be taken into account in queries? 




# BUG
