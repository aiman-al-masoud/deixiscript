Generalize "ownership chain" methods for any predicate.

Query for relations (method invocations), not just properties.

Get rid of RootAction, an Action should correspond to a Clause one-to-one.

Every Action gets a Clause in its constructor. Clause has nullable predicate and args fields.

Actions should be identifiable and queriable for "statement-level anaphora".
