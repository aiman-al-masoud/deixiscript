Maybe a Clause should take a Token (verb, noun, adjective ...) as its predicate, instead of a simple string.

# Benefits:

* 	one single central reference for all words
* 	being able to recognize a pronoun in Enviro (for anaphora)
* 	information about number and gender (for anaphora)
* 	generating auditory response (adjectives and nouns in correct order)

	
# Changes:

*   BasicClause.predicate : Token
*   Clause.describe(): Token[]

Maybe an interface above Token that only includes the Tokens that can actually be predicates?


A predicate as well as a concept could *be tied to a Lexeme*:

```
{
	"root" : "red",
	"concept" : "color"
}
```


```
{
	"root" : "of",
	"concept" : "ownership"
}
```	


# ------------------

# CSS-like Classes

```
any dangerous button is
	red,
	the width of it is 20vw,
	the height of it is 10vh
```

```
if any button is dangerous then
	it is red,
	the width of it is 20vw,
	the height of it is 10vh
```

You need to implement "and" (DONE), treat a comma as an "and", implement pronoun anaphora such as "it" in the Enviro, check if-then (Complex clauses), ImplyAction.


# Associating a predicate to a Concept (DONE)

```
red is a color.
yellow is a color.

red, yellow, green are colors.
```
