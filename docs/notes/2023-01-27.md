Trying to introduce mverbs as method calls.

Problem:

To be properly parsed, "method-name" must be considered a verb lexeme, but "method-name" doesn't exist yet as a lexeme, and the default way a new lexeme is created is as a noun!

It should also be possible to create aliases to the names of the methods, to have verbs that make some sense, and roll off the tongue!

Solutions:

1. (NEW & CURRENT): The [Lexer Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_hack) information from existing objects is fed back to the Lexer by means of the Context, so Lexer ca know (heuristically) if symbol is used as verb in a particular sentence.

1. (OLD) add all the method names of any newly wrapped object are dumpted to the lexeme global namespace as verbs.
