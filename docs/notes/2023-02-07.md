# Eager Lexer potential problem:

Eager lexer lexes everything before new grammar pieces start getting added as lexemes, so you cannot run one single string as startup command, because eager lexer has it all lexed at the beginning.


# Complex Sentences

* if x is red then x is blue
* x is blue if x is red

```
complex sentence 1 is nonsubconj 
		then condition sentence

		then consequence sentence
```
```
complex sentence 2 is consequence sentence
		then nonsubconj
		then condition sentence
```


# Position and other relational concepts

```
x appendChilds y 
```

should be equivalent to:

```
y is on x
```

```
position of y is x
```


# How to define relational concepts?

```
position of any button is an element because the element appendChilds the button.
```


# iverb sentence

just do it (DONE)

# ImplyAction shouldn't have other(), other() is really just a "MultiEditAction"
