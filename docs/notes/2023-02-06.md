# REPL vs "Compiled" mode

You need two "action execution modes":

1. REPL (already present) where any input statement runs as soon as it's converted to an Action. 
1. Compiled where a set of Actions is prepared, and then, only when a "run" command is given, runs.

Compiled mode would enable statement-level anaphora resolution and progressive statement refinement.

x is red.
before that, x is a button if it doesn't exist.
