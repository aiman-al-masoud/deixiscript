# REPL vs "Compiled" mode

You need two "action execution modes":

1. REPL (already present) where any input statement runs as soon as it's converted to an Action. 
1. Compiled where a set of Actions is prepared, and then, only when a "run" command is given, runs.

Compiled mode would enable statement-level anaphora resolution and progressive statement refinement.

```
x is red.
before that, x is a button if it doesn't exist.
```


Should Action extend Wrapper? So Actions can be stored just like any other object?

An Action that implements Wrapper could return a description of itself from `get clause()`, if the Action is stored in the env, it can be retrieved like that.


Or wrap an Action into a Wrapper?

Should lexemes also be objects?
