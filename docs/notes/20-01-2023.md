Made configurable compiler.

Now make metasyntax, and bootstrap the rest of the syntax on top of it and the basic building blocks (lexemes).

```
copulasentence is subject nounphrase then
		  copula then
		  predicate nounphrase.
		  
```

cs is nounphrase then copula then nounphrase then


With multi-word lexemes:

```
copula sentence is subject noun phrase 
		then copula
		then predicate noun phrase
```


Or


```
copula-sentence is subject noun-phrase 
		then copula
		then predicate noun-phrase
```



Problems:

on nounphrase both adjectives and complements are competing for stupid "lexemelist" slot. Just make two new ast-types (syntaxes), a list of complements and a list of adjectives.
