# Context Sensitive Lexing

Lexer gets full context (not just config).

This enables lexer to check if a lexeme is supposed to be a noun (property) or a verb (method) based on the object it is used on.

## Simple Heuristic

In a lexed sentence, if any lexeme evaluates (anaphora/enviro) to an object that has a method with the lexeme's name, that lexeme is a verb.


Mostly DONE, need to cleanup & refactor.
