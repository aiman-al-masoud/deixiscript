# Negation as Undo

x is red. //  stores new copy of x before applying red
x is big. //  x and copy of x are updated
x is not red. // "restores" non-red copy of x.

At any edit action A1 on an object X, a new copy is made of X and is kept up to date, except for what happened at A1.

When "A1 is negated" the copy is retrieved and it replaces the current object X.
