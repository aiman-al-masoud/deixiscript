1. Greetings & Title
1. Outline
1. Naturalistic Programming: what is it, why is it relevant
1. Recap of main programming paradigms (Graphical Timeline)
1. The need for naturalistic programming
    - precision/expressiveness tradeoff
    - semantic gap & scattering of ideas
    - AOP
    - some examples
1. Natural Style
    - implicit references
    - universal quantification
    - revisable rules
    - implied knowledge
1. Existing Work (maybe timeline)
    - Literate Programming
    - Metafor
    - Pegasus
    - CAL
    - SN
    - Inform 7
1. Prompt Engineering
    - LLMs
    - prompt structure
    - techniques
        - single-shot
        - few-shot
        - CoT
    - LLM settings
    - Risks
        factuality
        bias
        prompt injection
        prompt leaking
        jailbreaking
    - AI assisted coding
    - why not enough
1. Criticism of natural language programming
    - a lack of precision
    - verbosity
    - are legal documents really natural language?
    - what is natural anyway in SW?
1. Essence of Naturalistic Programming
    - high-level/low-level integration
    - reads almost as English
    - moderate use of implicit references
    - revisable rules
    - error reporting in natural style
    - declarative (with compromises) 
1. Common Sense in relation to naturalistic programming
    - what is common sense
    - points in common with NP
        - disambiguation & implied knowledge
        - revisable rules
        - automated planning & declarative programming
1. Deixiscript
    - origin of name 
    - goals and non goals
    - evolution
1. Implementation Details
    - language
    - libraries & licenses
    - parser
    - functional style 
    - interpreter pattern
1. Simple Sentences & Noun Phrases
    - the simple sentence
    - ASK/TELL
    - must be defined
    - the noun phrase
1. Syntax matching
    - Definitions
1. Knowledge Base
    - world model
    - short term memory
1. Orders and planning
    - facts vs events
    - potentials
    - search heuristic
1. Pronouns Example
1. Fish Example
1. Player/Enemy Example
1. Player/Enemy/Defender Example
1. Improvements
    - syntactic compression
    - semantic compression
    - better heuristics
1. Extensions
    - voice programming
1. Conclusions
    - natural language will grow in importance
1. Thank You!
