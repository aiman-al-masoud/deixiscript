The language of the code is Python (specifically version 3.10), annotated with type-hints and type checked by the Pyright static type checker.

The bulk of the code will adhere to a Functional Programming style: immutable objects and pure functions.

The English subset will be interpreted rather than compiled.

The core components of the interpreter will require no dependecies besides Python's (included) standard library.

The code will be available under GPLv3 for inspection and future research.
