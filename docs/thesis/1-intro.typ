// What is naturalistic programming?
// Old quote by Dijkstra.
// Why is it relevant today?
// Article by Matt Welsh.
// Prompt Engineering.
// Problems with not having a formalized understading natlang prog.
// State goals and non goals.
// Outline of the chapters.

// == Goals
// To show that is is possible to efficiently approximate some key features of natural language (implicit referencing and syntactic compression) with a formalized subset of it.

// To present the implementation of a formalized subset of the English language, showcasing said naturalistic features.

// To suggest that said formalized language subset may prove useful for some lightweight scripting tasks, particularly as a spoken language.
// == Non Goals
// The goal is not to make a full system, but rather to prototype a language. Modern LLMs provide a way to translate natural language to code, but we want a language rather than a probabilistic translator, we want to axiomatize that part of natural language that is useful for programming.



// // == The End of Programming

// // Computer Scientist Matt Welsh has argued that traditional programming done by humans will become obsolete as a result of the advancement of AI systems that can be told what to do in natural language and come up with solutions for problems they were never explicitly taught how to deal with (zero-shot learning).

// // However, the proliferation of guides on how to best use modern LLMs and the birth of Prompt Engineering suggests that a certain level of experience will be still needed to make effective use of these new "executable English" systems.

// // Natural language thus seems to be the new frontier of programming, and a decent understanding of natural language, its style at describing problems, its advantages over traditional programming languages and its limitations will be crucial over the next decades, as LLMs grow more powerful and useful.
