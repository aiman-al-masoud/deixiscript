= Introduction

// Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002) was a notable computer scientist, advocate of structured programming and famous for (among the other things): the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, the Banker's algorithm and the concept of semaphore in multi-threaded computing.

// Dijkstra wrote a short piece in 1978 lambasting what he called "natural language programming".

// Old quote by Dijkstra.
== What is naturalistic programming?

Naturalistic programming is broadly defined as the attempt to write (computer executable) code in a varyingly complex _subset_ of a natural language: the kind of language we are all naturally familiar with, and brought up speaking from a very early age.

We say "a _subset_ of natural language" because full, unconstrained natural language is (at least we think) still far too complex and dynamic to be used as a feasible programming language, without any constraints or limitations put in place whatsoever; and no one so far has agreed entirely on what that _subset_ should look like, let alone what it should (or shouldn't) allow us to say.

It was (and maybe still is) customary to dismiss these attempts with the justification that natural language is too "imprecise", too "vague" or too "ambiguous" for the job of telling computers what to do; that this job better suits formal languages, so why bother anyway?

Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002), the late, great computer scientist and early advocate of structured programming, famously wrote a piece in 1978 titled: "On the foolishness of "natural language programming" @foolishnessnatprogramming. In it he discusses what he (rightly) sees as the defects of natural language (ambiguity, verbosity...) compared to formal languages when describing mathematical concepts and computer algorithms. 

He goes as far as to argue to the effect that even if "natural language programming" were ever achieved, it wouldn't be a step in the direction of scientific progress, but rather a step back into the "dark" ages of mathematical notation: the rhetorical stage, back when equations were expressed in long, convoluted, confusing words, rather than in elegant and concise symbols.

And yet, we still speak natural language everyday: we listen to the news, we read books, we speak to our dearest friends and relatives, we trust natural language with the preservation of our legal rights and statues, with the preservation of our very democracy! How can such a vague, ambiguous, imprecise linguistical system (or systems) not be trusted at making sure our computers don't crash, yet be fully trusted in making sure the rest of our human society doesn't come crumbling down like a castle of cards? There's clearly more to say about natural language.

// State goals and non goals.
// Outline of the chapters.

// == Goals
// To show that is is possible to efficiently approximate some key features of natural language (implicit referencing and syntactic compression) with a formalized subset of it.

// To present the implementation of a formalized subset of the English language, showcasing said naturalistic features.

// To suggest that said formalized language subset may prove useful for some lightweight scripting tasks, particularly as a spoken language.
// == Non Goals
// The goal is not to make a full system, but rather to prototype a language. Modern LLMs provide a way to translate natural language to code, but we want a language rather than a probabilistic translator, we want to axiomatize that part of natural language that is useful for programming.

// // == The End of Programming

// // Computer Scientist Matt Welsh has argued that traditional programming done by humans will become obsolete as a result of the advancement of AI systems that can be told what to do in natural language and come up with solutions for problems they were never explicitly taught how to deal with (zero-shot learning).

// // However, the proliferation of guides on how to best use modern LLMs and the birth of Prompt Engineering suggests that a certain level of experience will be still needed to make effective use of these new "executable English" systems.

// // Natural language thus seems to be the new frontier of programming, and a decent understanding of natural language, its style at describing problems, its advantages over traditional programming languages and its limitations will be crucial over the next decades, as LLMs grow more powerful and useful.
