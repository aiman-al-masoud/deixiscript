= Philosophical Issues

In this section, we will outline some of the broad philosophical (metaphysical and epistemic) concerns behind envisioning and implementing a naturalistic programming system.

== Compositionality


Simple statement: "The meaning of a complex expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents."

It certainly holds for many artificial languages

variations to account for indexicality (occasional vs standing meaning)

The principle remains controversial


related principles: Substitutivity, 

"If two meaningful expressions differ only in that one is the result of substituting a synonym for a constituent within the other then the two expressions are synonyms." (Ssingular)

this is a stronger assumption than Compositionality, number of planets vs eight example
