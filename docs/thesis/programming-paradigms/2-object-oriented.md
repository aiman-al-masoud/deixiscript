# Object Oriented Programming

An extremely popular programming paradigm, supported to some degree by all of the most popular languages (2023), usually used in conjunction with [procedural programming](./1-procedural.md), and thus being often described as an imperative style of programming, though this need not be the case.

The core of OOP is the idea that objects should combine data and behavior into a single entity, which interacts with other entities through message passing. 

The traditional four pillars of OOP are: data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

An object should manage their state internally, hiding it from the others.

In practice, message passing is usually though of and implemented as a procedure call, though purely object oriented languages (and "actor-oriented" languages) do in fact exist.

Computer scientist Alan Kay, creator of the language Smalltalk, is usually cited as the "father" of OOP, albeit his own conception of the paradigm differs somewhat from the more popular procedural-based version.

Most OOP languages are class-based, a class is a template that is used to create instances of objects. This again, however, isn't the sole approach: a minority of languages are instead prototype-based: a prototype is a fully functioning object of its own, that can be cloned later if more instances of it are needed.

Inheritance is a moderately controversial topic among modern programmers, due to the rigidity of hierarchies, the problems related to refactoring, and the danger inherent to multiple inheritance (MI). Mixins and traits are slightly different modern alternative to MI.

Another important concept of (though not exclusively of) OOP is polymorphism: the idea that the same interface can apply to different underlying implementations.

The natural language parallels of OOP are many and varied: the concept of agents or efficient causes (data+behavior), the idea of these agents interacting together to achieve a common goal (message passing), and the subdivision of the world into concepts and subconcepts (classes and inheritance).
