# The End of Programming

Computer Scientist Matt Welsh has argued that traditional programming done by humans will become obsolete as a result of the advancement of AI systems that can be told what to do in natural language and come up with solutions for problems they were never explicitly taught how to deal with (zero-shot learning).

However, the proliferation of guides on how to best use modern LLMs and the birth of Prompt Engineering suggests that a certain level of experience will be still needed to make effective use of these new "executable English" systems.

Natural language thus seems to be the new frontier of programming, and a decent understanding of natural language, its style at describing problems, its advantages over traditional programming languages and its limitations will be crucial over the next decades, as LLMs grow more powerful and useful.
