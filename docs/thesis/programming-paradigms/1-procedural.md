# Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is a kind of Imperative programming, because it lets the programmer handle state and control flow explicitly.

There are other kinds of Imperative programming such as unstructured programming which makes use of goto statements, but Procedural programming relies on structured programming techniques (control flow structures such as loops and if statements rather than gotos) and procedures (a kind of routine) to modularize the program.

Procedural programming is an old and well established idea. Most of the popular general purpose programming languages nowadays (2023) fully support procedural programming, although none of them is "purely procedural". 

It is fair to say that it's the way most programmers first learn to code.

A Procedure is a kind of Routine (a distinct block/sequence of code intended to be reused) which, unlike a Pure Function, can have side-effects.

Procedural programming typically conceives data (primitives, structs/records) and instructions/behavior (statements, functions) as separate entities.

The natural language parallel of procedural programming is something like detailing the steps of a recipe.
