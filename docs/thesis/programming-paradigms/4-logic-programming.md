# Logic Programming

Logic Programming is based on a different branch of mathematics: formal logic, mostly predicate logic, though a few higher order logic based languages exist.

It is, not unlike FP, a declarative style of programming: logical implications are declared, usually in the form of a horn clause, and then are used to formally prove statements.
