# Matching by Synonymy

Two expressions are synonymous in a context kb, when their truth values co-vary in kb.  The truth value of a noun phrase is the existence of a referent.

You have a KB.
Add "specific", search for "generic" -> should be TRUE
Remove "generic", search for "specific" -> should be FALSE

if TRUE and FALSE accordingly, then "specific" is really specific and "generic" is really generic. Else the relationship might be inverted, or there might be no relatioship at all between the meanings.

# Analytic Derivations

allow for "idiomatic" speech

# Synthetic Derivations

# Pronouns

- Pronouns are defined through derivation clauses that have a constant (entity) with an implicit noun as their "definition" part and an implicit reference as their "where" part.

# Sentence overloading and precedence by specificity

sort derivation clauses by specificity, matching by synonymy comes in handy. Rules must be sorted by descending order of specificity of their definendum part.
