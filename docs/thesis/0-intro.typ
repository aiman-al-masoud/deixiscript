= Goals

To show that is is possible to efficiently approximate some key features of natural language (implicit referencing and syntactic compression) with a formalized subset of it.

To present the implementation of a formalized subset of the English language, showcasing said naturalistic features.

To suggest that said formalized language subset may prove useful for some lightweight scripting tasks, particularly as a spoken language.


The goal is not to make a full system, but rather to prototype a language. Modern LLMs provide a way to translate natural language to code, but we want a language rather than a probabilistic translator, we want to axiomatize that part of natural language that is useful for programming.
