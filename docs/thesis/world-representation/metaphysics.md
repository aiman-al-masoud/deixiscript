# Metaphysics

- At the most basic level there is nothing but: entities, is-a-relations and
  has-as-relations. This is the "interface" through which Deixiscript
  communicates with the outer world, including JS, which only uderstands has-as
  properties (not is-a ones because JS doesn't have multiple inheritance).


world model as the interface to the outer world


if there is an individual cat -> there is also the concept of a cat, concepts are "eternal", no need to create concepts in tell

- an entity is an AST leaf: a string a number or a bool, but any other AST type can be treated the same way

- is a concept supposed to be (isa) itself. Kind of, "be" is a weird verb

# A dialect of FOL

Machines like us

# Deixis

- Implicit references work as if any entity got the current timestamp whenever
  it was mentioned. When function ask() is called from findAll() the deictic
  dict is NOT updated, because the results from ask() are ignored.
