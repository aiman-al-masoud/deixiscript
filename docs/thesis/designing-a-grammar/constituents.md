## Drawing a parallel with programming language structures

[programmatic semantics](../../attachments/programmatic-semantics.pdf)

But:
- noun-phrases: expressions, constructors => point to things
- simple sentences: statements, procedures => point to actions, propositions or truth values


- Assignments are completely replaced by anaphora (implicit references), also in
  theme-rheme phrase style split in two sentences, also useful for intermediate
  numerical computations.

- Implicit References + Derivation Clauses can also be used to replace
  if-statements, because one big function with lots of ifs can be expressed as
  lots of small derivation clauses with naturalistic type (implicit reference)
  arguments declared on the fly.



- Verbs aren't functions, verbs are procedures. Noun-phrases (including implicit
  references) are expressions, and thus are much more akin to expressions/functions.
