- context sentitivity is incomplete
  - the cat eats the kibble piece
  - it jumps it resolves to "the kibble piece"


Experimental idea (for later or never): deictic dictionary could be "adjusted/biased" at any time to point to entities with specific qualities, maybe this could help to make the language more context sensitive. For example "it does jump" would increment the "timestamp" of jumping entities (based on the verb "jump") causing the pronoun "it" to point to one of them.
