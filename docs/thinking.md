A variable (top-level or not) can have:

1: concepts, for which specific getters and setters are available.

2: properties, which are just regular js attributes


color of x

may refer to the concept, in case x has a 'color' concept associated to it, or it may simply refer to a 'color' property on the variable resolved as 'x'.
