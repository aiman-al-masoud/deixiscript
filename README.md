# Deixiscript

Deixiscript is a prototype rule-based naturalistic programming language with limited automatic planning capabilities, described and implemented in my [master's thesis](./docs/thesis/aiman-al-masoud-thesis-deixiscript.pdf).

## Installation

- Make sure you have Python (version 3.10 or higher) and pip installed on your computer.
- Clone this repository.
- Navigate to the [`src/`](./src/) directory of this repository.
- Install the required dependencies with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- You may need to install Graphviz separately (the Python library is just a wrapper).
- (Optionally) run the tests to check if everything is ok with this script: [`./tests.sh`](./src/tests.sh)
- Run the interactive shell with this script: [`./repl.sh`](./src/repl.sh)

## Examples

Some examples are avaiable in the [`src/examples/`](./src/examples/) directory.
