# Deixiscript

Deixiscript is a simple naturalistic programming language, described and implemented in my master's thesis.

Naturalistic programming is broadly defined as the attempt to write computer
executable code in a varyingly complex subset of natural language. Our goal in
this work has been to explore how the existing naturalistic programming lan-
guages try to bring program specifications a little bit closer to the way humans
naturally describe things and processes, relating it to the broad topic of Com-
mon Sense in AI. The thesis also includes a practical part, where we try build-
ing a simple prototype of a rule-based naturalistic language following the prin-
ciples of the ones that we surveyed, and introducing a limited notion of auto-
mated planning to facilitate declarative programming.
